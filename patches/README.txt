Arduino USB device works perfectly well with other USB classes, but does not comply with Mass Storage Class requirements.
That is why I've made some changes into their code.
You have to do same otherwise your MSC device will not work or it will not be accepted in Windows.
Yes, Linux is not that picky.

I have reported some issues to Arduino team, so may be soon they will fix these issues.
